# Our mission

Schematic maps for public transportation networks are essential tools
for orientation and navigation in cities. Unfortunately, these maps are
usually proprietary resources that pose strong limits on what you are
allowed to do with them. The owners of the material often charge a fee
for displaying the content on websites, apps or printed material and
they don't allow you to change anything on the map itself. This alone
prevents creative use of these maps. Furthermore, you only get a PDF
document â€“ this makes interactive content hard to create. We're here to
change that by providing open source tools and file formats for
creating free schematic metro maps.

**In many cities and regions, there are no maps available at all!** As
[this article](https://qz.com/742755/nicaraguans-are-using-crowdsourcing-technology-to-prove-that-a-good-map-can-change-your-life/)
about a mapping project in Managua, Nicaragua points out, the
situation is pretty chaotic in some regions. When the local
transportation organizations do not provide a map, it is pretty useful
if the users of the transit network can collaborate on creating a map
on their own.

**Free maps are important.** Although maps are available for hundreds of
transit networks, it does make a difference if the maps are free.
People can get creative and start producing unexpected material. We've
seen these things happen in various Open Source and Open Data projects
in the past.

**Creating maps is hard.** It shouldn't be though. One should not need to
be a professional graphics designer in order to create a custom version
of a transit map. Nor should it require non-free software.

**Interactive maps allow new applications and increase their value to the
users.** From what we've seen, there are not many interactive
applications for transit maps yet. We believe there's potential for new
types of interfaces and ways to interact with maps. Traditional file
formats for images and documents don't offer much support for such
interaction.
