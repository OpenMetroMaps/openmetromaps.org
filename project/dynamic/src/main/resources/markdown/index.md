# Our mission
Schematic maps for public transportation networks are essential tools
for orientation and navigation in cities. Unfortunately, these maps are
usually proprietary resources that pose strong limits on what you are
allowed to do with them. The owners of the material often charge a fee
for displaying the content on websites, apps or printed material and
they don't allow you to change anything on the map itself. This alone
prevents creative use of these maps. Furthermore, you only get a PDF
document â€“ this makes interactive content hard to create. We're here to
change that by providing open source tools and file formats for
creating free schematic metro maps. [[Read more|mission]].

# Project status
The project is in alpha stage. Things are still changing quickly and
many things are not easy to use and fully functional yet. At this
point, some expertise in programming is required to get involved with
the project. To get an impression of what we're getting at, have a look
at the [[Demo page|demo]]. You can also follow us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/openmetromaps) or have a
look at the contributions we submitted to the OpenStreetMap with
[our OSM account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/OpenMetroMaps).
