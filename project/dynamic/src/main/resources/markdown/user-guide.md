# User Guide

The desktop software is already in a partially usable state, however there
are no installers available yet. Hence some familiarity with software
development is still required to get the software running. We hope to expand
this page soon, but up to now, please refer to the
[[Developer Guide|developer-guide]] for setup instructions.
